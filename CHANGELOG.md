# 0.2.0

## New Features

### Changing Default Library Type

We changed the default library type from "simple" to "Angular". So where previously you would run:

```
ng generate lib mylib // simple TS library
ng generate lib mylib --ngmodule // an angular library
```

Now, you run:

```
ng generate lib mylib // an angular library
ng generate lib mylib --nomodule // simple ts library
```

### Generating Router Configuration

You can pass `--routing` when generating an app.

```
ng generate app myapp --routing // generate an angular app with router config
```

The generated app will have `RouterModule.forRoot` configured.

You can also pass it when generating a library, like this:

```
ng generate lib mylib --routing
```

This will set up the router module and will create an array of routes, which can be plugged into the parent module. This configuration works well for modules that aren't loaded lazily.

You can add the `--lazy` to generate a library that is loaded lazily.

```
ng generate lib mylib --routing --lazy
```

This will also register the generated library in tslint.json, so the linters will make sure the library is not loaded lazily.

Finally, you can pass `--parentModule` and the schematic will wire up the generated library in the parent router configuration.

```
ng generate lib mylib --routing --parentModule=apps/myapp/src/myapp.module.ts
ng generate lib mylib --routing --lazy --parentModule=apps/myapp/src/myapp.module.ts
```
